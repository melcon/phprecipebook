			PHPRecipeBook FAQ

Q. Why does my Meal-Master file fail to import?

A. Many Meal-Master files that are available on the Internet or exported from a non Meal-Master program as Meal-Master are not necessarily Meal-Master files.  A lot of times the recipes are not correctly formatted and do not follow the Meal-Master specification (http://phprecipebook.sourceforge.net/docs/MM_SPEC.DOC).  If the file is not formatted according to the Meal-Master format it will not be supported.

Q. Why can't I include two entries for the same ingredient in a recipe, I need to be able to group recipe ingredients?

A. You should never have to enter an ingredient twice in a recipe.  If you need to group ingredients together for a sauce or some other sub-recipe then you should create a recipe for this.  So for example you would create a honey sauce recipe, and then in the chicken with rice recipe you would include the honey sauce recipe as a required related recipe.

Q. Why am I getting this error message:
  Fatal error: Call to undefined function: mysql_pconnect() in /var/www/html/phprecipebook/libs/adodb/drivers/adodb-mysql.inc.php on line 175

A. Most likely you do not have MySQL support compiled into PHP. In order to fix this problem you need to either recompile PHP with MySQL support or install the php-mysql package for you operating system.

Q. Why isn't X feature supported?

A. PHPRecipeBook is mainly centered around the ability to manage a weekly menu of meals.  This include the ability to plan the meals, create a shopping list and view and edit the recipe.  If the feature does not go to further these goals then it is not a priority and also may be rejected to avoid feature bloat.
